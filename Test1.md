> 1. Write a program to copy one string to another without using any loops or assignment operator by [Aaditya Mittal](https://github.com/aadityamittal).
> 2. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, …, 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100.
For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100 by [Abhipsha Sahu](https://github.com/07Abhipsha).
> 3. [Dynamic Array HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dynamic-array/problem) go through the link and solve this question proposed by [A S V K Vinayak
](https://github.com/ASVKVINAYAK).
> 4. Add two integers without using the '+' operator by [KSHITIZ RANJAN](https://github.com/kshitizranjan15).
> 5. Given a String containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations. A valid IP Address must be in the form of A.B.C.D where A,B,C and D are are numbers from 0 to 255.
The numbers cannot be 0 prefixed unless they are 0. 
Example: Given input: 25525511135 
Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"] ( Make sure the returned string is in sorted order) by [Rajat Kumar](https://github.com/RajatKumarA50).
> 6. Sorting of 2D array in both the manner i.e. in ascending and descending order, by the means of switch case operation an option which order sort should be provided to user.
Instructions to follow 1)All the elements of array should be entered by user no pre filled values are acceptable 2)Use of Inbuilt functions are restricted by [Rituraj Gupta](https://github.com/RiturajGupta21).
> 7. Given a string, the task is to count all the palindrome substring in the given string.
Example: Input :aba
Output : 4. Explanation : All the palindrome substring are : "aba", "a", "b", "a" by [Sahil Agarwal](https://github.com/agarwalsahil0210).
> 8. You are given N normal dice. Each die has dimensions 1x1x1. You can form four vertical columns of dice on the table, with base area up to 2x2 but total visible surface area of the structure must be the smallest possible.
A face of a die is visible if it does not touch the ground or another die. Each face of a dice has a value from 1 to 6. Your job is to stack the dice in such a way that the 
structure has minimum surface area and sum of values of visible faces is maximum. For Eg, 2 die on the table with face having value 1 touching the table and face having 
value 2 touching each other will have visible faces as 3,4,5,6 for each of them and their sum is 2*(3+4+5+6)=36.You have to take the number of dice N as input and print the maximum sum of 
values from visible faces by [Shubhanjan Dash](https://github.com/monkas24x7).
> 9. Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product. Note: Length of array is in the range :[3,104] and array element range: [-1000, 1000].
